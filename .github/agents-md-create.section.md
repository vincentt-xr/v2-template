### How `vincentt create` ends

`create` has two halves. The scaffold half writes the project source; the registration half
reserves the public address. They fail independently, and the exit code says which half you are
holding.

- **`0` — done.** The source is on disk and the address is reserved. `.vincentt/project.json`
  binds the folder to the project.
- **`3` — delivered, not registered.** This invocation wrote the project source, but no address
  was reserved: there is no account on this machine and no browser to get one, which is the
  ordinary situation in an agent's shell. **The project is complete and the local dev loop
  already runs** — install, `run dev`, and preview all work with no account at all. Only the
  public address is deferred. Report the project as built. Do not re-run `create` to "fix" this,
  and do not treat it as a failed build; the remedy is `vincentt login` on a machine with a
  browser, and it is optional.
- **`1` — nothing lasting was produced.** The command refused and no address was reserved. This
  covers sign-in started then abandoned, the address already being taken, no workspace resolving,
  and a missing name. Each of these is fixable with something you can type right now: a different
  `--name`, a chosen workspace, the missing flag, or completing the sign-in.

The distinction that matters: **`3` means you have a working project and `1` means you do not.**
A run that already scaffolded the source never reports `1` for want of an account.

`vincentt init <dir> --from <owner/repo@tag>` shares the same registration half and ends the same
way, for the same reasons — the code describes whether this run wrote the source, never which
verb was called.
