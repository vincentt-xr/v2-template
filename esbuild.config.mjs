// A creator's own repo config naming an arbitrary host would redirect their
// viewers' beacons to it, and a published bundle is unfixable afterward.
//
// Keyed by environment rather than parsed, so nothing here matches or derives a
// host. The publish apexes NEST (`vincentt.app` is a suffix of
// `staging.vincentt.app`), which is exactly why this is a lookup and not a suffix
// test — see internal/meter/host.go in the api repo for what that costs.
