# Vincentt Project — Template Grounding

This file documents the **template-local helpers** that live in this project's
`src/` (capture, gesture-hold, HTML overlays, sprite-sheet animation), plus
project-shape notes and common patterns.

The **SDK component/hook API** (`@vincentt-xr/sdk` — trackers, screen-space
layout, `<ScreenText>`, `<Panel>`, mesh/texture conventions) is **not** in this
file. It ships inside the SDK package, and in this project it is on disk at:

```
node_modules/@vincentt-xr/sdk/GROUNDING.md
```

This template currently pins `@vincentt-xr/sdk` to `2.0.0-alpha.5`. When that
version changes, re-check the installed SDK grounding and update examples against
the installed package rather than assuming older component behavior.

Read that file when you begin a scene. It is the authoritative reference for
every SDK component, hook, and prop, and it is far larger than this one — this
file covers only the template-local helpers. Nothing merges the two: if you have
read only this file, you have not yet seen the SDK API.

Run `pnpm install` first if the SDK grounding file is missing. The installed
package's grounding is authoritative for the exact SDK version in this project.

The same package also ships longer-form docs beside it in
`node_modules/@vincentt-xr/sdk/docs/` (guides, examples, per-API pages, and a
migration guide). Reach for those when the grounding reference is too terse.

Edit `src/Scene.tsx`. Compose the SDK components/hooks with the template helpers
below and R3F primitives. Use `<ScreenSpaceUI>` with `<ScreenText>` for ordinary
screen copy; use `<ScreenTransform>` when explicit authored transform/layout is
needed. There is no lifecycle DSL — per-frame logic is R3F `useFrame`, per-mount
setup is `useEffect`, both inside the scene component.

`App.tsx` already owns the platform shell. Do not add another `XRProvider`,
`XRScene`, `AspectRatioContainer`, `VideoBackground`, `PerspectiveCamera`,
media-source binder, or platform diagnostics inside `Scene.tsx`.

---

## SDK import doors

The SDK is split into task-domain entry points. A symbol imported from the wrong
door fails with "no exported member". The SDK grounding shows the literal import
for each API; this is the map of which door to open.

- **`@vincentt-xr/sdk`** — core: providers, scene, screen-space layout, runtime
  renderers (`Transform3D`, `MeshRenderer`, `SceneObjectRenderer`), `ScreenText`,
  `Panel`, `SpriteAnimation`, `VideoBackground`, `AspectRatioContainer`,
  capture/share (`useFrameCapture`, `useMediaRecorder`, `dataURLtoFile`), audio.
- **`@vincentt-xr/sdk/tracking`** — trackers: `FaceTracker`, `HandTracker`,
  `GestureTracker`, `BodyTracker`, `Segmentation`, `TrackingAnchor`,
  `GestureTrigger`, the bare `FaceMesh`, `useFaceResults`.
- **`@vincentt-xr/sdk/face-effects`** — face deep: FaceMesh material config,
  retouch, canonical mesh, head-binding.
- **`@vincentt-xr/sdk/scene-object`** — public authoring state: scene-object and
  component types, factories, selectors, immutable store operations, and the
  render-group API.
- **`@vincentt-xr/sdk/low-level`** — escape hatch: raw model-node reads, selector
  hooks, custom-tracker plumbing (`useXRContext`, `useXRReady`, `useXRError`).
  Reach here only when core + tracking can't express it.

Trackers self-register when mounted — no `registerXRPipeline` call.

## Camera effects, render layers, and DOM HUDs

`App.tsx` owns the one `VideoBackground` at `renderOrder={-999}`. Do not add a
second camera plane in `Scene.tsx`. For a camera-image effect, read the already
composed SDK texture with `useXRCameraTexture`, render nothing until it exists,
and put the custom full-screen material immediately above the background.

```tsx
import { useXRCameraTexture } from "@vincentt-xr/sdk/low-level";

const CameraEffect = () => {
  const cameraTexture = useXRCameraTexture();
  if (!cameraTexture) return null; // tracker/media startup and source swaps

  return (
    <mesh position={[0, 0, -0.98]} renderOrder={-998}>
      <planeGeometry args={[2, 2]} />
      <shaderMaterial
        uniforms={{ cameraTexture: { value: cameraTexture } }}
        vertexShader={vertexShader}
        fragmentShader={fragmentShader}
        depthTest={false}
        depthWrite={false}
        toneMapped={false}
      />
    </mesh>
  );
};
```

Use the same camera texture for a face-bound shader, but keep ordinary 3D
depth testing enabled so the mesh respects its own geometry. A translucent face
effect uses `transparent` with `depthWrite={false}`; add `alphaTest` only for a
deliberate hard cutout. Opaque 3D meshes normally keep both `depthTest` and
`depthWrite` enabled. `renderOrder` orders work within a render call; it does
not replace material depth settings or impose a universal order across opaque
and transparent queues.

For UI that must be captured in screenshots and recordings, prefer
`ScreenSpaceUI`, `ScreenText`, `ScreenImage`, or `ScreenShape`. Use the DOM
`<Overlay>` helper only for browser-native controls, QR codes, or other content
that must remain HTML. It starts with `pointerEvents="none"` and an `Html`
`zIndexRange`, so it cannot block camera gestures. Set `interactive` only for a
visible control with a deliberate touch target, then return it to noninteractive
when hidden. DOM z-index determines DOM stacking only; it cannot draw over a
later R3F pass, and DOM content is intentionally absent from canvas capture.

Verified references: [depth-lens camera shader](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/depth-lens/blob/main/src/Scene.tsx)
and [connect-pair interactive DOM HUD](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/connect-pair-game/blob/main/src/Game.tsx).

## Choose a scene architecture and state model

Keep the protected `App.tsx` shell responsible for session, camera, media, and
the one R3F canvas. Put experience composition in `Scene.tsx`, then choose the
smallest architecture that matches the scene:

- **Direct composition:** one fixed effect or a few related meshes. Compose
  tracker components, `ScreenSpaceUI`, and R3F nodes directly in `Scene.tsx`.
- **Delegated components:** an effect has its own lifecycle, assets, or input
  contract. Extract a named component and pass explicit props; the parent owns
  phase transitions and user-visible state.
- **DOM-first flow:** forms, games, QR handoff, or accessibility-first controls.
  Use `<Html>` / `Overlay` for DOM interaction and keep AR meshes as visual or
  tracking support. Do not place raw DOM inside the R3F scene.
- **Data-driven render groups:** only for editor-like, reorderable, or layered
  scenes. Use the scene-object store, `createRenderPlan`,
  `SequentialRenderPasses`, and `SceneObjectRenderer`; do not introduce render
  groups for a fixed two-mesh scene.

Use React state for values the user must see or that determine React structure:
phase, selected asset, score, visibility, and serialized scene data. Keep
per-frame counters, smoothed landmarks, object references, cooldowns, and
material uniforms in `useRef` and mutate them in `useFrame`. Promote a value to
React state only when a visible UI or component tree must change. This avoids a
render loop triggering React renders at camera frame rate.

Lazy-load a module when it is optional at startup, large, and isolated behind a
stable boundary: debug-only controls, a one-time scene, or a media-source
picker are good candidates. Keep startup-critical tracker, camera, and first
scene modules static. Gate the import itself, not only its rendered output, and
provide a `Suspense` fallback that does not obscure the camera.

The [Jungle themed AR scene](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/Jungle-themed-AR-Experience/blob/main/src/Scene.tsx)
is the advanced render-group reference; [Portrait Photobooth](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/portrait-photobooth/blob/main/src/Scene.tsx)
shows delegated experience state. Follow their data ownership, not their exact
assets or scene behavior.

## Assets and frame-loop performance

Use an asset path that matches its ownership. Put public, URL-addressable files
under `public/` and reference them from root (`/assets/frame.png`); use a static
ES module import for a scene-owned image, GIF, font, audio file, or model so the
bundler fingerprints it and reports a missing file at build time. Pass a loaded
`THREE.Texture` to `ScreenImage` or `SpriteSheet`; use a managed video/canvas
texture only when its frames must change at runtime. GIFs work through
`ScreenImage`'s GIF source or a sprite-sheet atlas. Do not use an alpha video
as a mobile overlay; use an alpha WebP/PNG atlas instead.

Preload assets that the first visible scene cannot work without, and defer
optional assets until the phase that needs them. A deferred import must be
behind the condition that makes it useful. Dispose manually created textures,
materials, audio nodes, timers, object URLs, and event listeners in an effect
cleanup; R3F disposes JSX-owned geometry and materials on unmount.

Keep repeated geometry, screen transforms, palette entries, and level layouts
as shared constants or data arrays, then map them into components. This gives
every repeated item the same coordinate and render rules, avoids copy/paste
drift, and lets a single phase/state value select the active data. Do not create
new vectors, textures, arrays, or React callbacks every frame.

`useFrame` is for mutable visual work: update refs, uniforms, mesh transforms,
or typed arrays there. React state is for a visible event or structural change:
a phase transition, score update, selected asset, or completed capture. If a
per-frame value needs to appear in the DOM, throttle or publish only meaningful
changes instead of calling a React setter at camera frame rate.

Working patterns: [Jungle sprite-sheet and ref updates](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/Jungle-themed-AR-Experience/blob/main/src/sprite.tsx),
[connect-pair data-driven board](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/connect-pair-game/blob/main/src/gameData.ts),
and the template's own `src/sprite.tsx` frame-loop implementation.

## Authoring self-review before handoff

Run this list after every scene change. It is deliberately short enough to use
in a new session; follow the linked sections when an answer is uncertain.

1. **Name both coordinate spaces.** State where the input starts (DOM client,
   normalized image, SDK tracker point, media pixel, or world point) and where
   it must finish (design pixels, `ScreenSpaceUI`, or world space). Use the
   [coordinate contract](#coordinate-contract--declare-the-source-before-placing-anything)
   helper for that pair.
2. **Convert once.** The selected SDK helper owns mirror, cover/contain crop,
   and origin changes. Delete any second `1 - x`, CSS mirror, manual crop, or
   Y-axis flip after that helper.
3. **Choose the primitive deliberately.** Use `ScreenText` for copy,
   `ScreenImage` for raster/media, `ScreenShape` for vector geometry, and a
   `ScreenTransform` only when composing lower-level screen content. Check the
   [screen primitive guide](#choose-the-screen-primitive-before-writing-layout-code)
   before adding a raw plane or DOM overlay.
4. **Mount only needed tracking.** Prefer app-facing tracker hooks/components;
   use `TrackingAnchor` for ordinary 3D attachment and the low-level door only
   for a custom measurement or skeleton. Declare tracker frame rate and verify
   loss/reacquisition behavior.
5. **Assign rendering ownership.** Keep one `VideoBackground`; choose canvas
   screen UI when it must be captured; make DOM HUD pointer capture explicit;
   and confirm transparency, alpha test, depth settings, and render order using
   the [camera/rendering guide](#camera-effects-render-layers-and-dom-huds).
6. **Check assets and frame work.** Use a supported asset path, preload only
   first-scene requirements, clean up manual resources, share repeated layout
   data, and keep per-frame mutation in refs rather than React setters. See
   [assets and frame-loop performance](#assets-and-frame-loop-performance).
7. **Cite a canonical precedent for nontrivial work.** Link a matching project
   under `Templates/Done` (not a historical experiment), explain the property
   being reused, and keep the new behavior scoped to the current template.
8. **Run matching proof.** Always run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`,
   and `pnpm build`. Run the [mobile acceptance harness](docs/mobile-xr-acceptance.md)
   for camera, tracker, source, responsive-layout, touch, capture, or overlay
   changes. Include the exact result and any required device evidence in the PR.

## Mobile acceptance before release

Use the development-only shell controls and the complete physical-device
[mobile XR acceptance harness](docs/mobile-xr-acceptance.md) before shipping a
template change. Its automated commands catch repository regressions; its
on-device checklist covers camera permission recovery, source and tracker
restart, orientation, touch, canvas capture, and overlay alignment.

## Coordinate contract — declare the source before placing anything

The SDK's [screen-space coordinate API](https://github.com/vincentt-xr/sdk/blob/main/docs/api/screen-space-coordinates.mdx)
is the source of truth for conversion ownership. This section records only the
template's pinned-SDK compatibility rule; update it when the template changes
SDK version instead of copying another coordinate implementation here.

Screen primitives use SDK design pixels by default: a 720×1280 canvas with its
origin at the centre and positive Y upward. Screen-pixel helpers map that canvas
across the full live viewport on each axis; it is not a letterboxed camera
coordinate system. `ScreenTransform2DSettings` is intentionally contain-fitted
so serialized editor layouts preserve their authored aspect ratio. Keep an
image's aspect ratio with its fit mode inside its screen rectangle, never by
adding manual crop or mirror math to its position.

| Source data                                | Origin and axes                            | Convert once with                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Face landmark or bounds from `useFaceInfo` | normalized tracker input; top-left, Y down | `normalizedToScreenPixels({ point, viewportSize })`                                          |
| Low-level hand, gesture, or body point     | centre-origin; X right, Y up               | `trackerPointToScreenPixels({ point, viewportSize })` in SDK versions that export it         |
| DOM pointer/client point                   | viewport top-left, Y down                  | `clientToScreenPixels({ point, rect })`                                                      |
| Camera-media pixel                         | source-media top-left, Y down              | `mediaToScreenPixels({ point, layout, mirrored })`                                           |
| World point                                | Three.js world space                       | `worldToScreenPixels({ point, camera, viewportSize })`; hide when depth is outside `[-1, 1]` |

**Convert a point once only.** The helper owns origin flipping, viewport mapping,
and any mirror/crop rule in its contract. Do not apply a second `1 - x`, manual
cover crop, or top-left/centre conversion afterward.

This template currently pins SDK `2.0.0-alpha.5`, which does not yet export
`trackerPointToScreenPixels`. Its `HandBoundingBox` retains the compatible
fallback: transformed tracker point → normalized top-left point →
`normalizedToScreenPixels`. When upgrading to an SDK version that exports the
helper, replace that fallback rather than keeping two conversion paths.

## Choose the screen primitive before writing layout code

- **`ScreenText`**: ordinary prompts, scores, instructions, and labels. Use its
  canvas `position` and `size` for authored design-pixel layouts.
- **`ScreenImage`**: raster images, GIFs, photo placeholders, and textured 2D
  overlays. It owns the screen transform; use `fit` for content aspect.
- **`ScreenShape`**: editable vector rectangles, circles, and lines. Use it for
  outlines, masks, and debug geometry; line endpoints are normalized within the
  shape, not design pixels.
- **`ScreenTransform`**: a responsive anchor rectangle for lower-level custom
  mesh or text composition. Anchors are `[-1, 1]`, centre-origin, Y up.
- **`ScreenTransform2DSettings`**: serialized/editor-compatible pixel layouts
  for `ScreenText` and `ScreenShape`. Resolve or merge these through SDK helpers;
  do not reproduce its mapping math in an app.

## Tracker choice

Use `useFaceInfo` or `useFaceDetection` for face logic and screen overlays;
their landmarks and bounds are normalized tracker-input values. Use
`TrackingAnchor` for straightforward 3D attachment to a named face, hand, or
body landmark. Read a low-level tracker node only for bespoke skeletons, cursors,
pinch measurements, or custom gesture state. Mount only the trackers the scene
uses, choose `targetFps` deliberately, keep per-frame values in refs, and use
React state only for visible phase or HUD changes.

## Tracking bounding boxes — from `src/FaceBoundingBox.tsx` and `src/HandBoundingBox.tsx`

The starter includes two reusable screen-space components. **The starting scene
runs face tracking only: hands are off by default.** `src/Scene.tsx` mounts
`<FaceBoundingBox />`; `src/HandBoundingBox.tsx` ships in the project but is not
mounted.

To add hands, add this import and this one line to `src/Scene.tsx`:

```tsx
import { HandBoundingBox } from "./HandBoundingBox";

<HandBoundingBox />;
```

Add hands only when the scene needs them. Each tracker adds its own model
download (the hand model is ~7.8 MB) and its own wasm compile on the phone, so
a second tracker costs the viewer that much more on first load and in memory.

The SDK supplies the tracking data and `ScreenShape`; these template components
turn that data into visible rectangle outlines. `FaceBoundingBox` reads the
blessed `useFaceInfo` bounds. `HandBoundingBox` reads the official hand model
node through `@vincentt-xr/sdk/low-level` because the SDK does not expose a
production `HandBoundingBox` component on an app-facing entry point. Its low-level
points are transformed tracker coordinates, not normalized tracker input. In the
currently pinned SDK it converts them once to normalized top-left coordinates and
then calls `normalizedToScreenPixels`; after the SDK upgrade described above it
will call `trackerPointToScreenPixels` directly. Neither route mirrors or crops
the camera feed a second time.

Both components are screen-space overlays and accept `color`, `padding`,
`opacity`, `strokeWidth`, and `renderOrder`. `HandBoundingBox` additionally
accepts `hand="left" | "right" | "both"`; omit it to show both hands. They
acquire the shared tracking models themselves. Add `FaceTracker` or
`HandTracker` separately only when you need to attach tracked 3D children or
use tracker contexts.

## Footer HUD — from `src/FooterHud.tsx`

Use `<FooterHud />` for the small HTML footer. It uses Drei's R3F `<Html>`
bridge, spans the full canvas width at the bottom edge, respects the device
safe area, uses subtle entrance/shimmer motion, and lets camera gestures pass
through.

---

## `useGestureHold({ gesture, holdMs, armDelayMs, enabled, onTrigger })` — hold-to-trigger (from `src/gesture.ts`)

`<GestureTrigger>` (SDK) is one-shot. `useGestureHold` fires after a gesture has been **held** for `holdMs`, debounced so a stray misclassified frame can't latch it. It re-arms when the gesture is released, so the next hold fires again. Needs a `<GestureTracker />` (SDK) mounted.

```tsx
import { GestureTracker } from "@vincentt-xr/sdk/tracking";
import { useGestureHold } from "./gesture";

<GestureTracker />;

// hold the peace sign ~0.6s to take the photo
useGestureHold({ gesture: "victory", holdMs: 600, onTrigger: takePhoto });
```

- `holdMs: 0` fires on first detection (instant); larger values require a deliberate hold.
- **`armDelayMs` (default 500) is the scene-transition guard.** When a gesture advances to a new scene, the user's hand is often still in that gesture as the next scene mounts — without an arm delay the new scene would fire instantly off the lingering gesture. The default keeps "the next scene doesn't double-fire" working out of the box. Pass `armDelayMs: 0` only if you genuinely want instant-on-mount.
- `enabled: false` gates it without unmounting (e.g. only accept the gesture after a celebration finishes).

```tsx
// Scene A: instant peace-sign advances to Scene B
useGestureHold({ gesture: "victory", holdMs: 0, onTrigger: goToSceneB });

// Scene B: the default arm delay ignores the peace sign that's still up from leaving A
useGestureHold({ gesture: "victory", holdMs: 0, onTrigger: goToSceneC });
```

---

## Capture (photo + video) — from `src/capture.ts`

Trigger-agnostic capture primitives. Wire them to whatever the project uses — a gesture, a click, a timer — the hooks don't care. Both flows return `{ blob, dataUrl }` so previews, downloads, uploads, and shares are all one-line follow-ups.

### `usePhotoCapture()` — single-shot photo from the live R3F render

```tsx
import { usePhotoCapture, saveToDevice } from "./capture";
import { GestureTracker, GestureTrigger } from "@vincentt-xr/sdk/tracking";

const { capture, latest } = usePhotoCapture();

<GestureTracker />
<GestureTrigger
  gestures={["victory"]}
  onTrigger={async () => {
    const photo = await capture();
    saveToDevice(photo, "snap.png");
  }}
/>

const LatestPreview = ({ dataUrl }: { dataUrl: string }) => {
  const texture = useTexture(dataUrl);

  return (
    <ScreenTransform anchors={{ left: 0.4, right: 0.9, top: 0.9, bottom: 0.6 }}>
      <mesh name="thumb">
        <planeGeometry args={[1, 1]} />
        <meshBasicMaterial map={texture} />
      </mesh>
    </ScreenTransform>
  );
};

// optional preview thumbnail (R3F mesh)
{latest && <LatestPreview dataUrl={latest.dataUrl} />}
```

### `useVideoCapture({ audio? })` — record the live canvas to a video blob

```tsx
import { useVideoCapture, saveToDevice } from "./capture";

const { start, stop, isRecording } = useVideoCapture({ audio: true });

<GestureTrigger gestures={["open_palm"]} onTrigger={() => start()} />
<GestureTrigger gestures={["closed_fist"]} onTrigger={async () => {
  const video = await stop();
  saveToDevice(video, "clip.webm");
}} />
```

`isRecording` is reactive — use it to drive a "● REC" indicator or pulse a UI element while filming. Audio is off by default so kiosk / silent contexts don't surface a mic prompt; pass `{ audio: true }` for mobile capture with sound.

### `saveToDevice(media, filename)` — browser download

Mobile: triggers the browser or OS save/share flow. Desktop: triggers a browser download to the user's configured download location. Kiosk contexts usually want to upload `media.blob` to a server instead — skip this helper and `fetch(uploadUrl, { method: "POST", body: media.blob })`.

### `shareMedia(media, opts?)` — native share sheet

Opens the OS share sheet (Instagram / WhatsApp / Messages) on devices that support the Web Share API with files; falls back to a download elsewhere. Returns `{ shared }` so you can branch — e.g. show a "scan to get it on your phone" QR when the native sheet isn't available.

```tsx
import { useVideoCapture, shareMedia } from "./capture";

const { stop } = useVideoCapture();

const video = await stop();
const { shared } = await shareMedia(video, {
  filename: "my-ar-clip.webm",
  title: "My AR clip",
});
if (!shared) {
  // desktop / kiosk: it downloaded instead. Show a QR or upload + display a link.
}
```

These template hooks are thin wrappers over the SDK's own capture surface
(`useMediaRecorder`, `useFrameCapture`, `dataURLtoFile` — all on the core door).
Prefer the template hooks: they manage the latest preview, return a `Blob` for
uploads, and keep the photo/video API shapes symmetric. Go direct to the SDK hooks
only when you need recorder state the wrappers don't expose.

For a low-level synchronous alternative, the SDK's `session.captureFrame(): string` returns a raw `data:image/png;base64,...` string.

---

## HTML overlays (QR codes, sharp DOM UI) — from `src/overlay.tsx`

Most chrome (frames, prompts, badges) belongs in the 3D scene via `<ScreenSpaceUI>` (SDK) — it composites with the AR content and tracks correctly. Use HTML overlays only for content that must be pixel-sharp and is awkward in 3D, chiefly **QR codes** (they moire and soften when projected onto a textured plane).

Overlays render as plain DOM positioned over the canvas, inside the portrait frame. They are NOT R3F — use HTML/CSS inside them, not meshes. Place an overlay anywhere in your `Scene.tsx` return; it portals visually above the canvas via absolute positioning.

### `<Overlay corner margin interactive>` — positioned DOM layer

```tsx
import { Overlay, QRCode } from "./overlay";

// "Scan to open on your phone" — kiosk entry point
<Overlay corner="bottom-right" margin={32}>
  <QRCode value="https://myapp.vincentt.app" size={180} />
</Overlay>;
```

`corner` is one of `top-left | top-right | bottom-left | bottom-right | center` (default `bottom-right`). `interactive` (default false) lets pointer events through so the overlay never blocks gestures; set it `true` only for a tappable control on a touch kiosk.

### `<QRCode value size light dark padded>` — crisp scannable QR

```tsx
import { usePhotoCapture, shareMedia } from "./capture";
import { Overlay, QRCode } from "./overlay";
import { useState } from "react";

const { capture } = usePhotoCapture();
const [shareUrl, setShareUrl] = useState<string | null>(null);

// after a capture, upload the blob and show a QR to the resulting URL
const onSnap = async () => {
  const photo = await capture();
  const { shared } = await shareMedia(photo, { filename: "snap.png" });
  if (!shared) {
    // desktop/kiosk: upload and surface a QR instead of a download
    const url = await uploadAndGetUrl(photo.blob); // your endpoint
    setShareUrl(url);
  }
};

{
  shareUrl && (
    <Overlay corner="center">
      <QRCode value={shareUrl} size={220} />
    </Overlay>
  );
}
```

Renders as SVG (sharp at any size). `padded` (default true) draws a white quiet-zone card so the code stays scannable over a busy camera feed. QR is **display/encode only** — there is no camera-side QR scanning in the template.

### Gotcha: give replaced elements (`<img>`, `<video>`) a sized wrapper

`<Overlay>` bridges out of the canvas via a wrapper that shrink-wraps its content. Text and `<QRCode>` carry their own intrinsic size, so they render fine. A bare `<img>` or `<video>` does **not** — it collapses to ~0px (just its border) and looks invisible. Wrap media in a `div` with explicit `width` + `height`, give it `overflow: hidden`, and let the media fill it:

```tsx
import { usePhotoCapture } from "./capture";
import { Overlay } from "./overlay";

const { latest } = usePhotoCapture();

// preview the last photo, bottom-left
{
  latest && (
    <Overlay corner="bottom-left" margin={20}>
      <div
        style={{
          width: 110,
          height: 146,
          overflow: "hidden",
          borderRadius: 10,
          border: "2px solid #fff",
        }}
      >
        <img
          src={latest.dataUrl}
          style={{
            width: "100%",
            height: "100%",
            objectFit: "cover",
            display: "block",
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </Overlay>
  );
}
```

The same applies to a `useVideoCapture()` `latest` preview — wrap the `<video>` in a sized `div`. (To preview captures as a 3D plane instead, use `useTexture(latest.dataUrl)` on a `<mesh>` inside `<ScreenSpaceUI>` — see the capture section.)

## Sprite-sheet animation — from `src/sprite.tsx`

A sprite sheet is one image holding a grid of animation frames. Use it for countdowns, animated stickers, mascots, and particle bursts — anything frame-by-frame.

> **The SDK also ships a sprite player — `<SpriteAnimation>` (core door).** The two
> are not interchangeable, so pick by where the sprite lives:
>
> - **Screen-space overlay** (a frame border, an instruction graphic, anything
>   anchored to the viewport) — use the SDK's `<SpriteAnimation sheet={{ url, cols,
rows, frames, fps }} anchors={...} />`. It must live inside a `<ScreenSpaceUI>`,

Two tiers:

### `<SpriteSheet>` — a single animated sprite (the common case)

A textured plane that cycles through the sheet's cells. Extra mesh props pass through, so it composes in screen-space (inside `<ScreenTransform>`) or world-space (inside `<TrackingAnchor>`) unchanged. Frames read left-to-right, top row first.

```tsx
import { useTexture } from "@react-three/drei";
import { SpriteSheet } from "./sprite";

const sheet = useTexture("https://cdn.../countdown.png"); // a 1x3 sheet: "3","2","1"

// screen-center countdown that plays once
<ScreenTransform anchors={{ left: -0.25, right: 0.25, top: 0.25, bottom: -0.25 }}>
  <SpriteSheet name="countdown" texture={sheet} columns={1} rows={3} fps={1} loop={false} onComplete={snap} />
</ScreenTransform>

// or pinned to the forehead as an animated sticker (4x4 sheet, looping)
<FaceTracker>
  <TrackingAnchor target="face.forehead">
    <SpriteSheet name="sticker" texture={stickerSheet} columns={4} rows={4} fps={12} scale={[0.3, 0.3, 1]} />
  </TrackingAnchor>
</FaceTracker>
```

Props: `texture`, `columns`, `rows`, `fps` (default 12), `loop` (default true), `playing` (default true — gate playback), `frameCount` (default `columns*rows`; set lower if the sheet has blank trailing cells), `onComplete` (fires when a non-looping animation ends). Plus any mesh prop (`name`, `scale`, `position`, `renderOrder`, `opacity`).

### `useSpriteSheet(opts)` — the hook, when you need the raw frame

Returns `{ map, frame, setFrame }`. Apply `map` to your own material; read `frame` for per-frame logic; call `setFrame(i)` to jump/restart. `<SpriteSheet>` is just this hook on a plane.

### `useInstancedSpriteUV({ texture, columns, rows, count })` — sprite particles (advanced)

For many sprites in one draw call (confetti, sparkles). It gives you only the reusable **mechanic** — per-instance UV cell + alpha through a pre-patched material — and you write the spawn/physics loop yourself (particle behavior is always bespoke).

```tsx
import { useInstancedSpriteUV } from "./sprite";

const sprite = useInstancedSpriteUV({
  texture: confettiSheet,
  columns: 4,
  rows: 4,
  count: 1500,
});

useEffect(() => {
  const g = meshRef.current.geometry;
  g.setAttribute("instanceUvOffset", sprite.uvOffset);
  g.setAttribute("instanceAlpha", sprite.alpha);
}, []);

useFrame((_s, delta) => {
  // your physics: move each instance's matrix, set its cell + alpha
  sprite.setCell(i, cellIndex); // which sheet cell this instance shows
  sprite.alpha.setX(i, fade); // per-instance fade
  sprite.alpha.needsUpdate = true;
});

<instancedMesh ref={meshRef} args={[undefined, sprite.material, 1500]}>
  <planeGeometry args={[0.1, 0.1]} />
</instancedMesh>;
```

## Common patterns

Each pattern names which primitives compose it (SDK components + template helpers). Use as starting points; combine and adapt freely.

### gesture-photo-booth (the canonical photo flow)

- `<GestureTracker />` (SDK) to enable gesture detection
- `<ScreenSpaceUI>` (SDK) overlay with a "do the peace sign" prompt and decorative frame
- `<GestureTrigger gestures={["victory"]} onTrigger={...}>` (SDK) fires the capture (or `useGestureHold` for a debounced hold-to-trigger)
- `usePhotoCapture()` (template) returns the photo; hand to state, download, or share
- Optional: 3-2-1 countdown `<SpriteSheet>` (template) before the capture

### face-decoration (single-scene face effect)

- `<FaceTracker>` wrapping `<TrackingAnchor target="face.forehead">` (SDK) with a 3D mesh/texture
- Optional `<FaceTracker.Mesh />` (SDK) for full deforming face coverage
- No interaction required — the decoration simply follows the face

### hand-effect / body-effect

- `<HandTracker>` or `<BodyTracker>` (SDK) + `<TrackingAnchor target="hand.indexTip">` / `<TrackingAnchor target="body.leftShoulder">`
- 3D objects follow the landmark each frame

### segmentation-background

- `<Segmentation type="portrait" />` (SDK; registers the segmentation pipeline; mounts alongside a state/ref for the mask)
- Pass the resulting mask texture to `<VideoBackground segmentationMask={mask} customBackground={replacementColor} />` (SDK) in App.tsx

### gesture-controlled (no tracker visuals)

- `<GestureTracker>` + `<GestureTrigger>` (SDK) drives effects (particles, scene transitions, animations) without any visible hand/face overlay

## Notes

- `VideoBackground`, camera, and lighting are already mounted in `src/App.tsx`. Do NOT add a second background plane — it covers the camera.
- Assets are referenced by **URL**. For the platform's curated library, run
  `vincentt assets search "<what you want>"` — see the Assets section in `AGENTS.md`.
- Tracker components self-register — no `registerXRPipeline` call needed.
- Always name your meshes — `name="..."` enables runtime lookup and visual-feedback editing.
