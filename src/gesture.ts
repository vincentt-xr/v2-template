// Gesture helpers for Scene.tsx.

// The SDK's <GestureTrigger> is one-shot (fires once per recognition event).
// useGestureHold adds the *hold-to-trigger* pattern — fire after the gesture
// has been held for `holdMs`, debounced so a single misclassified frame can't
// latch it. This is the natural fit for "hold peace sign to take the photo" or
// "hold open palm to advance".
