// The shell's beacon wiring. The subject is the CALL SITE, not the beacon: that
// the never-edited shell mounts it once, feeds it the SDK's session state, and
// unmounts it cleanly.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT MOCKED, because it decides what this suite can prove:
//   - `@vincentt-xr/analytics` is NOT mocked. The mount and the session feed go
//     through the real package, so the argument shape asserted here is the shape
//     the package actually accepts. A hand-written fake would assert this repo's
//     GUESS at another package's surface and stay green while the two drifted.
//   - the SDK's session hooks ARE faked. `useXRReady` and `useXRError` are what
//     this suite VARIES to drive the wiring; the SDK producing them correctly is
//     the SDK's own suite.
//
// The beacon is inert off a published address and jsdom runs on `localhost`, so
// nothing is sent here BY DESIGN. That is what makes the mount safe to assert
// without a network seam: the property under test is that the shell wires it and
// survives, not that a request leaves.
