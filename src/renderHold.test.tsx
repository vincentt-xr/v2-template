// framing handles and a fake stream, the same seams the framed-startup suite uses.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT MOCKED, because it decides what this suite can prove:
//   - `@vincentt-xr/harness` is NOT mocked. The messages below go through the real
//     parser, the real origin check and the real source check. A hand-written fake
//     channel here would assert this repo's GUESS at the harness's wire shape and
//     stay green while the two drifted.
//   - `<XRScene>` IS mocked, to a component that records the props it was handed.
//     `frameloop` is r3f's, consumed inside a real WebGL canvas jsdom cannot run;
//     the assertion is about WHAT THE APP HANDS THE SDK, which is exactly the
//     boundary the design fixed (`canvasProps`, not a bare `frameloop`).
//   - the SDK's session IS faked. Applying a source is not this suite's subject;
//     the ORDER it happens in relative to the release is.
