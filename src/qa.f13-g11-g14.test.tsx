// 4C-template · QA-F13-G11 (superseded) and QA-F13-G14 (retired), from
// features/changes/console-owns-frame-chrome/qa.md.
//
// ── [retire QA-F13-G14] · THE WEBCAM FILTER IS GONE, AND SO IS ITS CASE ───────
//
// G14 asserted that the framed switcher filtered the webcam entry out of its
// source list, leaving a dead Camera tab whose reachable behavior it then pinned.
// ITS SUBJECT NO LONGER EXISTS. The frame now delegates camera
// (`D-The-frame-delegates-camera-and-the-no-grant-property-is-spent`), so the
// filter was WRONG rather than merely unnecessary and was removed with it —
// `switcherSources` is deleted from `framed.ts`. There is no framed switcher, no
// filtered list and no dead tab left to assert, and
// `D-The-webcam-filter-leaves-a-dead-tab` is RESOLVED rather than documented.
//
// The old G14 block is not rewritten into something else. A retired case whose
// tests are repurposed keeps a green tick alive for a behavior nobody decided;
// the honest record is the reason above plus the absence assertion below, which
// is what stops the filter quietly returning.
//
// ── [supersede QA-F13-G11] · THE FRAMED APP RENDERS ONLY THE APP ──────────────
//
// f13's G11 pinned the framed SWITCHER's behavior (which preset it defaulted to,
// that it never chose the webcam). 2A.C6 removes the mount entirely, so the
// subject moved: what must now be true is that NOTHING of the app's own chrome
// mounts when framed, and that all of it still mounts when not.
//
// R5 — BOTH ARMS IN ONE SUITE. The framed arm alone is satisfied perfectly by a
// build that deleted the controls outright, which would break every creator's
// local `vincentt preview` loop. "Gated, not deleted" is a claim about TWO
// states, so the unframed arm is not a nicety here; it IS the case.
//
// The harness's half of this (the Share overlay's NEW framed gate, the feedback
// chip, the annotation module's dynamic import) is asserted in
// toolchain/packages/harness/src/client/qa_f13_g11_framed_mounts.test.ts. This
// file owns the TEMPLATE's half: the in-app media control.
